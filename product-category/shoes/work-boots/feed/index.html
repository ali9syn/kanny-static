		<description><![CDATA[<p>Calver Tor Boot in burgundy Horween Chromexcel with 100% wool felt lining and cushioned foot bed</p>
 <p>Inimitable waxy pull up calf leather made by Chicago's finest, Horween, for nearly a century</p>
 <p>It has a full leather sole with a choice of Serac top-sole, commando top-sole or hobnails (hardcore boot buffs only)</p>
 <p>It is also available with metal horseshoe heel plates (for even hardercore boot buffs!)</p>
 <p>Fitting Advice - the Tor Boots are sizing up snug on the instep (lower half of laces area) and given that you will probably wear them with thicker socks, we recommend going up a size if you are in any doubt</p>
 <p>The hobnails and horseshoe heel plates make the boots slippery in the city so we recommend them for off road only</p>
<p><i>Designed in London, made in England and travelling the world.</i></p>]]></description>
