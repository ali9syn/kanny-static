Beautiful leather shoes are a great investment, but they do need looking after if you want the investment to pay off and for them to stay looking good…a man is still judged by his shoes!

This course aims to show you just how relaxing and satisfying cleaning and polishing a pair of shoes can be. Bring along a pair of your favourite leather shoes (no Nubuck, suede or patent please) and we'll show you how to give them a new lease of life; whilst enjoying a glass or two of your favourite tipple – we’ve a well-stocked drinks cabinet!

You’ll be shown how to:
<ul>
 	<li>Clean and nourish the leather</li>
 	<li>Fill in the scuffs and scratches</li>
 	<li>Give a base polish</li>
 	<li>Create a military shine on the toes – glaçage</li>
</ul>
There’ll be plenty of time to chat and ask questions and, with no sharp tools involved, you’ll be perfectly safe buffing and imbibing!
