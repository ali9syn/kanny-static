There’s no greater feeling than the satisfaction of making something yourself and our hand stitched leather courses offer the perfect opportunity; with short evening, half day and day courses to choose from.

On this short course you will learn to make a beautiful, Italian leather card case, perfectly sized for travel, business or bank cards.

<li>How to punch the stitch holes and to set your work in a clam</li>
<li>How to use an awl and stitching needles</li>

</ul>

We hope that this practical course and the comprehensive notes supplied in class will set you up for saddle stitching in the future.
