Beautiful leather shoes are a great investment, but they do need looking after if you want the investment to pay off and for them to stay looking good…a man is still judged by his shoes!

This course aims to show you just how relaxing and satisfying cleaning and polishing a pair of shoes can be. Bring along a pair of your favourite leather shoes (no Nubuck, suede or patent please) and we'll show you how to give them a new lease of life; whilst enjoying a glass or two of your favourite tipple – we’ve a well-stocked drinks cabinet!

You’ll be shown how to:
<ul>
 	<li>Clean and nourish the leather</li>
 	<li>Fill in the scuffs and scratches</li>
 	<li>Give a base polish</li>
 	<li>Create a military shine on the toes – glaçage</li>
</ul>
There’ll be plenty of time to chat and ask questions and, with no sharp tools involved, you’ll be perfectly safe buffing and imbibing!

If you’d like to book this class as an experience for yourself and a group of friends, please email us at <a href="mailto:courses@carreducker.com">courses@carreducker.com</a> with further details and we’ll be delighted to tailor something to suit you.]]></description>

</ul>

<p>A shoe making course where you can learn traditional, hand welted shoe making at your own pace, under the careful guidance of master shoemakers James Ducker and Deborah Carré.</p>

<p>The shoe making evening courses are for beginners and take place on Monday and Wednesday evenings from 6 - 9pm, in 10-week terms. There is a waiting list for places so, if you are interested, please email us to let us know which evening you would prefer. (In our experience, students usually take three terms to complete a pair of shoes).</p>

<p>At the start of the shoe making course you will be given a set of comprehensive course notes and a pack of shoe making materials - lasts to work on in your chosen size (the forms the shoes are made on); leather uppers (you will have chosen either black or dark brown); and “rough stuff” leather for the soles etc.</p>

<p>In the following weeks and months, we will guide you through the 200+ steps in the shoe making process - lasting, welting, stitching on a sole, building leather heels and then finishing the shoes, all by hand. You will work with specialist hand shoe making tools - from the shoe making knife (you best friend or worst enemy depending on how sharp it is), sleeking bone and lasting pliers to sewing awls, irons and a French pattern hammer – and traditional shoe making materials – oak bark tanned leather, tar, thread wax and hemp thread.</p>

<p>At the end, you will proudly walk away with a pair of shoes that you have made yourself!</p>]]></description>

On this one-day shoe making course you will learn one of the most important elements of shoe making, hand lasting.

This is the stage of pulling the leather shoe upper over the last (the forms that the shoes are made on) and securing it in place first with nails and then contact cement. It is one of the most important because a hand lasted shoe has a beautiful shape, exactly following the contours of the last.

During the day, we will guide you through:
<ul>
 	<li>Shaping your insole (the leather footbed inside the shoes that the foot rests on)</li>
 	<li>Inserting a stiffener at the heel and a toe puff at the toe to strengthen the shoe, give it shape and hold it on the foot</li>
 	<li>Hand lasting your uppers over, nailing and then cementing them in place and hammering them to shape.</li>
</ul>
You will work with four specialist shoe making tools – a shoe making knife (your best friend or worst enemy depending on how sharp it is), lasting pliers, a leather hammer and nippers.

At the end of the day your shoes will be sent off to our specialist cobbler to have a leather sole and heel attached before being carefully boxed up and delivered back to you ready to be worn!

<p>On this five-day shoe making course you will learn two of the most important elements of hand sewn shoe making, hand lasting and hand welting.</p>

<p>Hand lasting is the stage of pulling the leather shoe upper over the last (the forms that the shoes are made on), where it is secured in place with nails. It is one of the most important because a hand lasted shoe has a beautiful shape, exactly following the contours of the last.</p>

<p>Hand welting is the next stage, where a strip of leather is stitched by hand around the edge of the shoe. This is the foundation for attaching the sole and heel.</p>
<p>You can choose from five shoe styles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plain derby shoe</li>
<li>Plain Oxford shoe</li>
<li>Brogue Oxford with a straight toe cap</li>
<li>Brogue Derby with a straight toe cap</li>
<li>Full brogue and gimped Derby with a straight toe cap</li>
</ul>
<p>And four different leather colours:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acorn</li>
<li>Chocolate</li>
<li>Burgundy</li>
<li>Black</li> 
</ul>
<p>During the week, we will guide you through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shaping your insole (the leather footbed inside the shoes that the foot rests on)</li>
<li>Creating a holdfast; a ridge in the insole that you will stitch through</li>
<li>Inserting a stiffener at the heel and a toe puff at the toe to strengthen the shoe, give it shape and to hold it on the foot</li>
<li>Hand lasting your uppers over and nailing them temporarily in place</li>
<li>Making a welt</li>
<li>Making threads</li>
<li>Sewing the welt around the edge of the shoe</li>
</ul>
<p>You will work with three specialist shoe making tools – a shoe making knife (your best friend or worst enemy depending on how sharp it is), lasting pliers, nippers, a leather hammer and a sewing awl and mitt.</p> <p>
At the end of the day your shoes will be sent off to our specialist cobbler to have a leather sole and heel attached before being carefully boxed up and delivered back to you ready to be worn!</p>

<li>1 – 13 October 2018</li>
<li>7 – 19 January 2019</li>
<li>13 – 25 May 2019</li>
<li>8 – 20 July 2019</li>
<li>29 July – 10 August 2019</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="#wp-content/uploads/2018/06/book-time.png" alt="Time" class="size-full wp-image-2881" /><span>Time:</span> 9:30am – 5:30pm Monday to Saturday</li>

</ul>

<p>This shoe making course is intensive, cramming an exhilarating 96 hours of shoe making into 12 days! It’s been described by students as being the ‘boot camp’ or ‘iron man’  equivalent and you’ll certainly get a great physical and mental workout as you navigate the 200+ processes involved in hand sewing a pair of shoes. But don’t be put off; most students are complete beginners and the hard work is balanced by a great and very well-deserved, sense of achievement at the end!</p>

<p>At the start of the shoe making course you will be given a starter kit of tools, a set of comprehensive shoe making notes and a pack of shoe making materials - lasts to work on in your chosen size (the forms the shoes are made on); leather uppers (you will have chosen either burgundy, black or dark brown); and “rough stuff” leather for the soles etc.</p>

<p>In the following days, we will guide you through the shoe making process. You will work with specialist hand tools - from the shoe making knife (you best friend or worst enemy depending on how sharp it is) and lasting pliers to welting  awls, square awls, edge irons and a fudge wheel – and traditional shoe making materials – oak bark tanned leather, tar, thread wax and hemp thread.</p>

<p>After some 96 hours of shoe making, you will proudly walk away with a pair of shoes that you have made yourself!</p>
