</ul>


There’s no greater feeling than the satisfaction of making something yourself and our hand stitched leather courses offer the perfect opportunity; with short evening, half day and day courses to choose from.

On this short course you will learn to make a beautiful, Italian leather card case, perfectly sized for travel, business or bank cards.

<h2>Course description</h2>

The course is taught by leather craftsman Frankey Pinnock (link to biog) formerly of Bill Amberg Studio and now a bag maker for Simpsons. Through demonstration, trial and guidance she will teach you:

<ul>
<li>How to prepare and finish the leather edges</li>
<li> How to cement the layers of leather together</li>
<li>How to punch the stitch holes and to set your work in a clam</li>
<li>How to use an awl and stitching needles</li>
<li>How to saddle stitch and to finish your work</li>
</ul>

We hope that this practical course and the comprehensive notes supplied in class will set you up for saddle stitching in the future.

<h2>Materials</h2>

All the materials needed for the course are provided.]]></description>
